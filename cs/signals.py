"""Three things the store never records, read back out of what it does.

Copilot's session store has no column for approval mode, no parent-session
link, and no notion of a credential. All three matter once you are answering
for the work: which sessions ran unattended, which work was handed from one
session to the next, and which conversations have a password sitting in them.

Each is inferred here, and every verdict carries the evidence it was drawn
from — a judgement you can check is worth more than a number you have to
trust. Nothing in this module writes to the store.
