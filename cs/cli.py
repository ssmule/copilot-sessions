  {ui.BOLD}Notes{ui.RST}
    {ui.DIM}· N refers to a row from your last listing — 'cs show 3' or 'cs show #3'.
    · N stays with its session when you sort or filter, so it's safe to note.
    · Any unambiguous id prefix works too — that's the short id in footers.
    · Credits = AI units (AIU) spent, from the store's usage records — a
      session's whole life, every run of it, compaction and sub-agents
      included. Copilot CLI's status line counts only the run you are in,
      so on a resumed session it reads lower. 'cs show' splits the total.
    · Listings count the skills a session referenced and the sub-agents it ran;
      sort with --sort skills or --sort agents.
    · Reads $COPILOT_HOME/session-store.db (default ~/.copilot), read-only.
    · Colours are tuned for a dark terminal; CS_THEME=light for a pale one.
    · CS_GLYPHS=ascii swaps every emoji for a plain marker.
    · Empty & automated sessions hidden by default; 'cs all' shows them.
    · Hide extra summaries by prefix in $COPILOT_HOME/.cs-ignore.
    · Credentials are masked in every view; CS_REDACT=0 shows raw text.{ui.RST}

  {ui.BOLD}Interactive mode{ui.RST}
    {ui.DIM}'cs' opens the landing screen; every view returns to it:
      ↑/↓    move down the menu           Enter  open the highlighted view
      type   narrow the menu as you go    Esc    clear what you typed
      /      full-text search             q      quit (when nothing is typed)
      ←/→    the window the counting views use — Stats, Timeline, AI spend
             and Delegation. Those rows say which window they will use, and
             Enter opens them with it.
      click  open, wheel scrolls

    'cs recent' and 'cs search' run full-screen in a terminal:
      ↑/↓    move the row cursor        ←/→    sort by prev/next column
      Enter  resume the session         v      brief: goal, outcome, open
      o      show: cost, files, turns    t      transcript: the conversation
      s      reverse the sort order     /      filter as you type
      g/G    jump to first/last         Esc    clear filter, then quit
      q      back to the menu, or quit
    Key hints shrink to fit a narrow window rather than being cut off, so
    the keys you cannot guess stay on screen.
    The mouse works too: click a row to select it (Enter then resumes),
    double-click a row to resume it straight away, click a column header
    to sort by it, and scroll with the wheel.
    Sorting keeps the highlight on your session, so it never moves out
    from under you.{ui.RST}

  {ui.BOLD}Sorting{ui.RST}
    {ui.DIM}Listings — recent, all, search, 'files <path>':
      --sort credits|turns|active|summary|repo|relevance [--asc|--desc]
      In a terminal, ←/→ pick the column and 's' reverses it.

    Reports — repos, timeline, cost, skills, profiles, hooks, mcp,
    yolo, handoff, audit:
      --sort <column> [--asc|--desc]; each report lists its own columns in
      its footer, and rejecting a typo prints them too.
      Opened from the menu, ←/→ and 's' re-sort without leaving the report.

    Every default is the order the report already came in, so sorting only
    ever happens because you asked for it.{ui.RST}

  {ui.BOLD}Explaining{ui.RST}
    {ui.DIM}cs <view> --why       How to read the view, section by section

    Reports print their findings and hold back their lessons. A paragraph
    explaining what a p95 is belongs on your first run, not your fiftieth,
    and a tool built for daily use should default to the fiftieth.
    CS_WHY=1 asks for the lessons every time, for as long as they help.{ui.RST}
