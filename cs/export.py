"""Machine-readable output — the same readings, without the drawing.

Every view in `cs` is built to be read by a person: it wraps, it colours, it
puts a rule over a heading and a footnote under a number. None of that
survives being piped, and a tool whose numbers can only be looked at is a
tool that stops at the edge of the terminal.

This module is the other edge. `--json` on a view hands back the figures it
would have drawn, as plain data, so the same store can feed a spreadsheet, a
dashboard, a weekly report or a CI check without anyone screen-scraping a
bar chart. It is deliberately a *separate* path rather than a flag threaded
through the renderers: a report that has to serve two audiences in one
function ends up serving neither, and the drawn views stay free to change
their layout without changing anyone's contract.

Two rules hold everywhere here:

* **Redaction is not optional.** Anything that can carry a credential goes
  out through the same masking the drawn views use. Piping is exactly when
  text stops being glanced at and starts being stored.
* **Absent is absent.** A reading this store cannot answer is left out
  rather than emitted as zero, matching the rule the rest of the codebase
  keeps: a missing column is a missing answer, not a nil result.
