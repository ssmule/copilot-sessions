"""Every command, run — against a full store, an empty one, and an old one.

The rest of the suite tests what each view *says*. This tests that each view
still runs at all, which is a different and blunter question, and the one a
refactor actually breaks. It is deliberately structural: the command list is
read out of `cli._dispatch` itself rather than typed here, so a command added
next year is smoke-tested the day it is added and an alias that quietly stops
dispatching fails the suite rather than waiting for a bug report.

Three stores, because the same code meets three shapes of them:

* the fixture store, which has every table;
* an **empty** store — a fresh machine, or a window with nothing in it, where
  every count is zero and every list is blank;
* an **old** store, carrying only `sessions` and `turns`. The schema belongs
  to Copilot, not to `cs`, so a release that has not shipped
  `assistant_usage_events` yet — or renames it — is the single most likely
  way this tool breaks on somebody else's machine. `db.optional` and the
  `has_*` guards exist for exactly that, and nothing was running them across
  the whole command surface.
